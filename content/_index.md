Hello! My name is Deepak Surti. I am a Software Engineer with a focus on 3D Graphics and it's
applications across various domains. I am lucky that I am paid to work on 3D Graphics which also
happens to be both a passion and a hobby. 

I enjoy programming and try to keep myself busy with interesting, relevant side projects.

My toolkit is to use Lisp for rapid prototyping and using the relevant production language
appropriate for the 3D application and the platform.

This is my personal website, and you will find here thoughts, ideas, code, opinion that I came up
with during my personal time outside of my paid, professional work commitments. The projects that I
have worked on professionally and are in the public domain are attributed so explicitly.
